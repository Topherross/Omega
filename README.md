# Omega.js

## Introduction

Omega.js is a small vanilla javascript library for the most common functions used by front-end developers in one-off scripts.
For years developers have relied on heavy libraries to accomplish these simple, and repetitive tasks.
While doing so the bulk of the already loaded library remains unused. This creates a much larger network overhead than necessary.
Omega.js allows developers to load a much smaller library to accomplish tasks like toggling element classes, modals, ajax requests, and event listeners.
